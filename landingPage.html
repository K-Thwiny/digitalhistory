	<header>About This Website</header>

	<p>Welcome to my digital history project on slavery, christianity, and colonialism.  I have reimagined my dissertation research in concrete modules that allow visitors to explore material, listen to archival documents, examine historical maps, among other activities.  Each module examine a key theme of my research.  I have also created lesson plans for secondary school educators.  These lesson plans will help explore differing conceptions of slavery, the concept of agency and its limitations, and political consciousness under colonial rule.</p> 

	<p>The Volta Region and what became German Togoland was awash in slavery and only intensified when the German government arrived in 1884.  While Britain and France, no paragons of abolition in Africa, Germany more explicitly attempted foster an environment where slaves could be brought into the colony.  This increase in slaveholding has its roots when the North German Mission arrived in the 1840s.  After an initial failure to establish a congregation, missionaries turned towards purchasing enslaved children and prosletyzing them.  Click on "Slavery in Togoland" to find out more</p>
